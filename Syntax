Syntax reference for the mouse language.

Stack references used in the descriptions below:
X refers to the top number of the stack.
Y refers to the second number on the stack.

Boolean Values:
0 is a False.
Any other value is TRUE.

Miscellaneous:
<space>     Spaces have no action except inside a string.
{           Enable execution tracing.
}           Disable execution tracing.
~           Comment. Everything to the end of the line is ignored.
$           Marks the end of the program. (See also Macros below.)

Variables:
A-Z         Variables. Each returns the address to the variable location.
:           Store a value into a variable address. Ex. 42 A:
.           Retrieve a value from a variable address. Ex. A.

Math:
0-9         Integer literals.
+           Adds two numbers and leaves the sum.                Y + x
-           Subtracts two numbers and leaves the difference.    Y - X
*           Multiples two numbers and leaves the product.       Y * X
/           Divides two numbers and leaves the quotient.        Y / X
\           Divides two numbers and leaves  the remainder.      Y % X

Input and Output:
?           Read a number. The value is placed on the stack.
?'          Read a character. The ASCII value is placed on the stack
!           Output a number from the stack.
!'          Output an ASCII character from the stack.
"Text"      Output a string.
'<Char>     Put the ASCII code for the character on th stack.

Conditional:
<           Returns True if Y < X, otherwise returns False.
=           Returns True if Y = X, otherwise returns False.
>           Returns True if Y > X, otherwise returns False.
[]          Conditional execution. If X is true the contents are executed.

Loops:
()          The contents are executed repeatedly.
^           If X is False exits a loop.

Macros:
$           Defines a Macro. Macros are a single letter, A-Z, case insensitive.
#           Calls a Macro.
@           Exit from a Macro.
%           Inside a Macro refers to numbered parameters.
,           Separates parameters in a macro call.
;           End of a Macro call.
